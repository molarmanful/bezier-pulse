# Bezier Pulse

![](./cycle.gif)

I decided to expand on my previous experimentation with sine waves; this time, instead of using circles, I went with Bezier curves. This allowed for much more flexibility in creating motion and variation, so I decided to play around with variations in amplitude.

The result is a wave that pulses every second, somewhat reminiscent of soundwaves or EKG readings. Although a relatively simple piece, the difficulty came in making each Bezier curve extend out in an aesthetically pleasing way.
